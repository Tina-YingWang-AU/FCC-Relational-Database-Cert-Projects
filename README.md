# Relational Database Certification Projects

This repository is a centralized portfolio of five professional-grade database projects completed for the **freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification**. It demonstrates a transition from foundational schema design to complex, automated data systems using **PostgreSQL** and **Bash**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Core
* **DBMS**: PostgreSQL
* **Scripting**: Bash (Advanced CLI automation & ETL pipelines)
* **Design Patterns**: Relational Mapping, Schema Normalization (1NF/2NF/3NF), Data Integrity Constraints.
* **Tools**: Git, Terminal-based DB management, RegEx for input validation.

## 📂 Project Directory

### [01. Celestial Bodies Database](./01-Celestial-Bodies-Database/)
* **Focus**: Complex Relational Architecture.
* **Key Achievement**: Designed a multi-table universe schema (Galaxies, Stars, Planets, Moons) with strict foreign key constraints and unique identifiers to ensure astronomical data integrity.

### [02. World Cup Database](./02-World-Cup-Database/)
* **Focus**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline.
* **Key Achievement**: Developed a Bash script to automate the migration of tournament data from CSV to PostgreSQL. Implemented complex SQL queries to extract historical performance analytics.

### [03. Salon Appointment Scheduler](./03-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler/)
* **Focus**: Full-stack CLI Application.
* **Key Achievement**: Built an interactive appointment system that manages customer registration and scheduling in real-time.

### [04. Periodic Table Database](./04-Periodic-Table-Database/)
* **Focus**: Database Refactoring & Data Cleaning.
* **Key Achievement**: Modernized a legacy dataset by refactoring schemas, correcting data types, and standardizing chemical properties. Features a multi-input query script (Atomic No., Symbol, or Name).

### [05. Number Guessing Game](./05-Number-Guessing-Game/)
* **Focus**: User State Persistence & Logic.
* **Key Achievement**: Engineered a game engine that tracks user history and personal bests. Demonstrates the ability to bridge application-level logic with database-level updates (`INSERT/UPDATE`).

## 🎓 Learning Milestones
- **Schema Evolution**: Mastering `ALTER TABLE` and `UPDATE` for real-world data maintenance.
- **Automation**: Using Bash to handle repetitive database tasks and data injection.
- **Advanced Querying**: Utilizing `JOINS`, `AGREEMENT`, and `SUBQUERIES` to derive business insights.

## 🚀 Environment
- All projects are built to run in a Linux/Unix environment using PostgreSQL 12+.
